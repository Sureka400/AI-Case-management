**PROBLEM STATEMENT:**
Individuals who handle cases in insurance and government offices have to explore a number of rules and documents in the process of working. 
Such documents are filed in different locations; therefore, the involved employees take a lot of time to search and sometimes end up using the wrong rule.
It leads to misinterpretation in the document prediction and descions.
Consumes lot of time for the manual Process.
**SOLUTION:**
We develop an AI-based smart assistant which is capable of understanding the case information and displaying the proper rules and policies on the screen automatically. 
The system also displays the exact source of the document so that users can rely on them to take proper decisions on time.
Make descision by using the AI agent and time taken to do the work is much decrease than manual.
It automatically extract the text which is in the PDF or SOP
